Whispers of the Wind

The wind hums softly through the trees,
A gentle dance, a quiet tease.
Leaves shimmer gold in morning light,
A fleeting song, a pure delight.

Clouds drift lazily across the sky,
Echoes of dreams that flutter by.
Time moves on, yet here I stand,
Feeling the world slip through my hand.

Moments fade, yet memories cling,
Like the tender touch of spring.
In every breath, in every sigh,
The heart learns how to laugh and cry.
